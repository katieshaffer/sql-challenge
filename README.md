# SQL Challenge
## Overview
This repo contains my SQL queries for the case studies from [Danny Ma's SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)
It demonstrates SQL skills like use of CTEs, windows functions like `DENSE_RANK`, aggregate functions like `STRING_AGG` (equivalent of `LIST_AGG`), and more.
